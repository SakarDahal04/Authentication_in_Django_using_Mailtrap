When we click the ""Forgot Password?"" button in the login page, then we will get one form that will ask for the email of the user.

For that form, at first we make the form API.

So we make the form with form API named PasswordResetForm with a fields email.
    Then we created custom validation for the email using the function clean_email. 
    This checks if the user exists in the database based on the email the user sends.

    After that return the email.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the user clicks form button, it will call the view. 

    In the view there is already the code that will run when the form is to be rendered
    Now we mention the code for the POST request.
