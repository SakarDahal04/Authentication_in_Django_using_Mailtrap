This will be one complete authentication system.

This will contain
    one homepage    
    one registration page -- from where we send the email to the activation mail you register from from which you can activate the account and login into the account.
    one login page -- 
    two dashboard based on the authentication of the user --  customer or seller
    password change page and reset the password based on the email
    
This will use the function based view.

Make UI for all of the html pages and then start working on the authentication part

We need to decide at first if we want the user model that django provides or to make the custom user model for the user.
It has to be done before the migration is done for any of the user.

At the first regsitration, each of the user will be logged in as the customer. 
Later by application, he/she can be upgraded to the seller.
